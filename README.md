Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
	Artemis Financial is a company that consults its customers with individual financial plans. They would like to modernize its operations which includes effective software security for its public web interface.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
	One thing I did well when I found software security vulnerabilities in the client software was finding fixes for the issue. Software security adds to the company’s overall well-being by protecting sensitive data.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
A part of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging to me was getting the server to connect to the web browser. I had applications using the same ports, so I had to trouble shoot how to clear the port and how to change it.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
	To increase layers of security I completed dependencies check to make sure that the application was not at risk of attacks from things like outdated libraries. I also added certificates and secure communication.  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To increase layers of security I added secure communications throughout the application as well as completing dependencies testing.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Resources that were helpful in these assignments were the Iron-Clad Java textbook and Oracle Java Security Standard Algorithm Names. Iron-Clad Java and Oracle gave me tips to implement the requirements.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
	This assignment will show future employers that I am capable of implementing secure communication practices as well as being able to design and implement code that complies with software security testing protocols.
